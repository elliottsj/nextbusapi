 * By creating an Interface for all Geocoded types, it's very easy to implement generic proximity sorts.
 * At first this Interface looks like excess from Overanalysis or excessive OOAD, but once you dive into
 * implementing domain classes, you identify patterns that motivate you to further segregate types. 
 * This interface allows me to sort Stops and Vehicle locations - which really is the whole point of
 * having geocodes in the first place.
