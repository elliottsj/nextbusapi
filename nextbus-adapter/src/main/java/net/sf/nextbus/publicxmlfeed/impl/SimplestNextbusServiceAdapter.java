/**
 * A Simple and Easy Service Adapter to NextBus and the fastest way to get rolling.
 * <p>
 * It's simple and easy because it uses the Java.Net.UrlConnection RPC provider and thus
 * requires no addition JAR dependencies - just the vanilla JRE 5 or above.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    Service svc = new SimplestServiceAdapter();
 *    Agency mbta = svc.getAgency("mbta");
 *    List<Route> mbtaRoutes = svc.getRoutes(mbta);
 *    Route route110 = Route.getRoute(mbtaRoutes, "110");
 * 
 *    List<VehicleLocation> bussesOnThe110 = svc.getVehicleLocations(route110);
 *    System.out.println("There are currently "+bussesOnThe110.size()+" busses running The 110");
